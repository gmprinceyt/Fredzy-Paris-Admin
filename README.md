# Fredzy-Paris-Admin

A clean, maintainable admin dashboard for the Fredzy Paris application. This repository contains the admin interface and related tooling (build scripts, CI, docs). Use this README to get the project running locally, build for production, and contribute.

> NOTE: This README is intentionally generic so it fits most admin-dashboard stacks (React, Vue, Angular, or server-rendered admin panels). Adjust commands, dependencies, and environment variables to match the actual technology used in this repository.

## Features
- User and role management (CRUD)
- Product/catalog management
- Order and payment overviews
- Activity logs and audit trails
- Search, filters, and pagination
- Responsive layout for desktop and tablet
- Configurable permissions and settings

(Enable or remove features depending on implementation.)

## Tech stack
- Frontend: React 
- State management: Redux 
- Backend API: REST
- Build tools: Vite 
- Styling: Tailwind / Shadcn UI

Update this section to reflect the actual stack used in this repo.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended 16+)
- npm 
## Getting started

### Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmprinceyt/Fredzy-Paris-Admin.git
cd Fredzy-Paris-Admin
# using npm
npm install
```

### Environment variables
Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` (if present) and fill in required variables such as API endpoints and keys:

Example `.env` entries (replace with actual variables used by the app):

```
API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

### Running locally
Start the development server:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
# or
npm start

```

Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port configured in `.env`).

### Building for production
Build the optimized production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

Serve the built files (example using a static server):

```bash
npx serve -s dist
```

Adjust `dist` to your build output directory (`build`, `public`, etc).

## Testing
Run unit and integration tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Add or update tests to cover new features and bug fixes.

## Linting & formatting
Keep code style consistent with the project's lint and format rules:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Configure editors to run Prettier/ESLint on save (if configured).

## Deployment
Deployment varies by hosting target:

- Static frontend (Netlify, Vercel, Surge) — deploy build output directory.
- Containerized (Docker) — build an image and push to a registry.
- Server-hosted — serve built files with Nginx or integrate with backend renderers.
- 
## Project structure
A typical layout (update to match this repo):

- src/                — source files
  - components/       — UI components
  - pages/            — page-level components / routes
  - services/         — API clients, auth
  - store/            — state management
  - styles/           — global styles
  - utils/            — helper utilities
- public/             — static assets
- tests/              — test suites
- build/ or dist/     — production build output
- scripts/            — dev & deployment scripts
